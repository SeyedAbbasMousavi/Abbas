So what we do is that we specify the limitations and constraints for a problem; then we specify what we want to optimize (Objective function), do we want to maximize the performance or minimize the cost or the weight or etc. then we use computational simulation to find the optimized design which maximizes (or minimizes) objective function while satisfying constraints.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--left\" src=\"https://SeyedAbbasMousavi.github.io/ Abbas/media/posts/2/large.jfif\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\"><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://SeyedAbbasMousavi.github.io/ Abbas/media/posts/2/heat-sink-OP.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"736\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We start with dividing the available domain (available physical space) in to N elements.
